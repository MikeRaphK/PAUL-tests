The file `src/reverse_string.py` contains a buggy function. 
Its correctness is tested in `tests/test_reverse_string.py`. 
Your task is to fix the function(s) in `src/reverse_string.py` so that all tests in `tests/test_reverse_string.py` pass. 
Do not modify any files in the `tests/` directory. Use the tests only as a reference to guide your fix. 
After making changes, verify your solution by running `pytest tests/test_reverse_string.py`.
